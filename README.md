**# Using SVG**

1. Went to icomoon.io
2. Selected IcoMoon App
3. Added Entypo+
4. Selected following icons
   1. bookmark
   2. Chevron-thin-right
   3. aircraft-take-off
   4. chat
   5. home
   6. key
   7. location-pin
   8. magnifying-glass
   9. map
   10. star
5. selected gear icon for preferences (on bottom left)
6. removed PNG option
7. Download
8. unzip
9. We just need SVG and symbol-defs.svg

This file is called a sprite file. It's an SVG file that contains all of the 10 SVG images in it.

That way we only have to use 1 global file for all icons. That means only 1 http request.
